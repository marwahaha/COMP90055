# COMP90055

This is the repository for my computing project. Including:

1. Java files to use Twitter4j to retrieve tweets:
       
   Stream Data:  
   	MyFullStream.java: Used to retrieve stream data.  
	MyStream.java: Used to retrieve partially stream data (only those tweets that has latitude and longitude data). It is used at 
	   first to retrieve stream data but collect just a few tweets and abandoned. Might be used if anyone is interested in.

   Historical Data:
	ANZFollowerTimeline.java: Used to retrieve historical data of tweets from the followers of @ANZ_AU.
	CBAFollowerTimeline.java: Used to retrieve historical data of tweets from the followers of @CommBank.
	NABFollowerTimeline.java: Used to retrieve historical data of tweets from the followers of @NAB.
	WBCFollowerTimeline.java: Used to retrieve historical data of tweets from the followers of @Westpac.
        
   MyTweet.java: In the above java files, tweets are first stored in MyTweet objects and then stored in couchdb.6
